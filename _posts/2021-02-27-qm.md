- **Axiom 1** To every quantum system there is associated a separable complex Hilbert space $$ ( \mathcal{H}, + , \cdot , \langle \cdot \vert \cdot \rangle \, ) $$. The states of the system are all positive, trace-class linear maps $$ \rho :  \mathcal{H} \to  \mathcal{H}$$  for which $$ \text{Tr} \, \rho = 1$$.

- **Axiom 2** (Observables). Tue *observable* of a quantum system are the self-adjoint linear maps $$ A :  \mathcal{D}_{A} \to  \mathcal{H}$$.

- **Axiom 3** (Measurement). The probability that a measurement of an observable $$A$$ on a system that is in the state $$\rho$$ yields a result in the Borel set $$E$$ of real numbers given by \$$ \mu(E) \; = \; \text{Tr} \left( \, \mathrm{P}_A (E) \, \rho \, \right) \$$ where $$\mathrm{P}_A $$ is map from the Borel-measurable subset of the real numbers to the Banach space of bounded linear maps on $$\mathcal{H}$$ and is defined as the unique projection-valued measure that is associated with $$A$$ according to the spectral theorem.

- **Axiom 4** (Unitary dynamics). In a time interval $$(t1, t2)$$ in which no measurement occurs, the state $$\rho$$ at time $$t_1$$, denoted $$\rho(t_1)$$, is related to the state $$\rho(t_2)$$ at time $$t_2$$ by  \$$ \rho(t_2) \; = \; U(t_2-t_1) \, \rho(t_1) \, U^{ - 1}(t_2-t_1) \$$ with the unitary evolution operator $$U$$ defined as \$$ U(t) = \text{Exp} \left( - \frac{i}{\hbar} H \right) \$$ where $$H$$ is the energy observable.

- **Axiom 5** (Projective dynamics). The state $$\rho_{\text{after}}$$ of a quantum system immediately following the measurement of an observable $$A$$ is  \$$ \rho_{\text{after}} = \frac{ \mathrm{P}_ A(E) \rho_{\text{before}} \mathrm{P}_ A (E)  }{ \text{Tr} \left( \; \mathrm{P}_ A(E) \rho_{\text{before}} \mathrm{P}_A (E)   \; \right) } \; , \$$ 
where $$ \rho_{\text{before}}$$ is the state immediately preciding the measurement and $$E \subset \mathbb{R} $$ is the smallest Borel set in which the actual outcome of the measurement happened to lie.
